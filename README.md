## My Favorite Projects

❤️ Below you'll find the projects that I had a really good time working on. <br>
🎓 Most projects were made for University courses.


### Natural Language Processing
Check out the [BOT][ktane bot] I made for the *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* game:
+ 💣 Disarm any bomb using my BOT!
+ 🗣️ Speak to the BOT, in order to get the right answers.
+ 🔊 The BOT will **tell you**, using built-in voice, how to disarm the bomb!
+ 🗒️ Read the [BOT Manual][ktane bot manual], in order to use it correctly!

<br>

### Game Jam
Check out the [Video Game][ggj repository link] we made with my team as an entry to the [Global Game Jam of Athens][ggj athens]. The theme was "Roots". In this video game, the goal is to **find the root of your family tree**. With several possible suspects, you have to collect the right clues and see who fits better with the backstory of your root!

The game is called "Paternitree" and is [available for download][ggj download link]. Feel free to give us feedback!

**I am currently reworking this game** in my [GitLab Account][paternitree gitlab]. Check out the repository and [download the reworked version of the game][reworked paternitree download]!

### ML-Agents
Within the course of "Intelligent Agents", I was able to make with my team a really interesting **NPC kart that goes on its own!**

<br>

### Artificial Intelligence 
Check out my [Artificial Intelligence][ai project] project, where I worked with **Genetic Algorithms**. The goal was to find any solution for the following **CSP** (Constraint Satisfaction Problem): ***"Every box should be coloured individually using either Blue, Red, Green or Yellow. No box can have the same colour as its neighbours."***
